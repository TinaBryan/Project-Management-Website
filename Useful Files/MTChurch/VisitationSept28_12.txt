Subject: Visitation

Dear Deacons,
It is the end of September (already!!) and we need to be completing our visitations this week or next.  This is the assignments I have for September:
Loraine - Joyce
Virginia - Jerry
Rusty and MaryLou - Dodi
Helen - Kathy/Judy
 
The only people signed up for visitation in October are Kathy/Ellie to go see Virginia
That means the following people will need a visit in October:
Loraine -
Rusty and MaryLou -
 
If you were not at the meeting in September, please email me and let me know if you can visit one of these two people in Oct.  If you do not want to do the visit by yourself, just give another Deacon a call.
Please be sure to read the September minutes (Judy has already sent them out via email) about Jack and Communion, and about the sermon CD's.
 
October greeters: Jerry and Rikke    November greeters:  Edward and Brianne
October 2nd session rep: Joyce         November 6th session rep: Edward
 
Next meeting:  November 12, 2012
 
Have a blessed week.
 
Dodi
